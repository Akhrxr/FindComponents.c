   FindComponents.c // The main program that will take two command line arguments giving the names of an input file and an output file.
// The input file will have vertices and the output file will return the adjacency lists, distances between vertexes
// and their shortest paths if they exist.

    List.h // Contains the public portion of the struct/class for operations in Graph.c 

    List.c // Contains the private portion of the struct/class for operations in Graph.c 
    
    Graph.h // Contains the public portion of the struct/class for operations in FindPath.c 

    Graph.c // Contains the private portion of the struct/class for operations in FindPath.c Chose to
    //use global time variable for functions visit() and DFS() as it was the simpilest to do in this 
    //instance.

    GraphTest.c // Tests the functions of the Graph ADT in a proper manner to check for memory leaks and inefficiencies. 

    *//Both list.h and list.c as well as Graph.h and Graph.c 
    //will include their constructors/destructors, member functions, and manipulation procedures.//*
